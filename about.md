My name is William Parrish,  i work as an Android Developer for a company in NYC that specializes in mobile ticketing within the transit space. I'm a NC native, OEF Veteran,  self-taught programmer,  and a Android and Java instructor at local programming meetups for beginners. 
I seek mastery,  and the opportunity to help others attain it.
