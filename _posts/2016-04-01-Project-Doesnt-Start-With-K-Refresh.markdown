Revisiting our goals for version 1 of the project can be summarized as follows:

    1. Identify and call an appropriate SeatGeek endpoint.
    2. Set up the corresponding Data class
    3. Define the relationship between JSON results and Data Class.
    4. Populate UI

### Identify and call an appropriate SeatGeek endpoint.
