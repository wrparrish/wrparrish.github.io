Welcome to the blog!  
Like many of my peers,  i have decided to jump on the blogging train.  I was motivated by a post by [Hannes Dorfmann](http://hannesdorfmann.com) in which he graciously provides  clear guidance on getting started with Jekyll and github pages.  After those steps, and a quick stop by [A Small Orange](https://asmallorange.com) to secure a domain name, i am up and off to the races.  Why 'Ruthless Programming' as a domain name?  I have always  used the phrase Ruthlessly Insufficient to give a tongue in cheek description of failure,  or poor results. As a self taught programmer, one of  my major breakthroughs in personal and professional progression was the realization that i didn't know everything,  and that this was ok. My main goal with this blog though is to acknowledge and leverage the things i do know,  or am in the process of mastering, and then using this knowledge to help others. I think also it is helpful to put  work up and seek criticism from others,  so i do hope that the criticm is harsh, yet just,  and flows freely.  That is one of the best ways i know to improve.
